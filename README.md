# Congress CLI
This project is intended to integrate with two API's that provide facts and details about our political system.
- https://api.congress.gov/
- https://api.propublica.org

The current goal is build out a CLI that returns information about the actions our political representatives take as well as their funding sources.

## Next
After completing initial integrations the plan is to extend this library to implement a Slackbot that uses the same commands to return information.
